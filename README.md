# IT Course Assignments

This repository contains the assignments I work on during my IT course study at NHL Stenden Emmen.

## Structure

In the root folder you can find 3 folders. Weekly, extra and portfolio. Weekly contains more sub-folders (week1, week2...) each containing assignments that were worked on during the corresponding week. Portfolio contains any assignments that might be a part of the final portfolio. Extra contains anything that does not fit within those 2 categories.

## Usage

All assignments are linked on the mainpage.php file. When opened in browser it will display all the assignments within this repository in an organized structure.
