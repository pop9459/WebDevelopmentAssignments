        /*
          By using the global PHP $_FILES array you can upload files from a client computer to the remote server.

          The first parameter is the form's input name and the second index can be either "name", "type", "size", "tmp_name" or "error". 
          Like this:

         * $_FILES["file"]["name"] - the name of the uploaded file
         * $_FILES["file"]["type"] - the type of the uploaded file
         * $_FILES["file"]["size"] - the size in bytes of the uploaded file
         * $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"] - the name of the temporary copy of the file stored on the server
         * $_FILES["file"]["error"] - the error code resulting from the file upload

          This is a very simple way of uploading files. For security reasons, you should add restrictions on what the user
          is allowed to upload.
